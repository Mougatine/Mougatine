  <p>My Name is <b>Arthur Douillard</b>, but you can (should) call me BoBibelo.
  I was born in Paris, and lived most of my life there. It's a wonderful city,
  which i feel everyone should visit at least once in their life.</p>

  <p>Since i was born i travel all over the world in every continents, but Antartica.
  I love to speak differents languages (French, English, Spanish, and a bit of Chinese and
  korean. But the true reason i travel, is food. I love exotic food, i crave for exotic food !</p>

  <p>I'm at the moment a Computer Science student at <b>EPITA</b>, located in Paris.
  During the spring of 2015, i made an exchange semester with <b>Hanyang University</b>
  in <b>Seoul, Korea</b>. I learned one thing from there: Korea is heaven for tech aficionado.</p>

  <p>Since i was little i was amazed by science: Science about dinosaurs, then space, then physics,
  and finaly computer. During my free time (which is quite rare at EPITA) i'm programming
  <a href="https://github.com/BoBibelo?tab=repositories">stuff</a> that i can use in my every day life.
  This point is important as i feel more motivated when i'm able to create a program that has usefulness.</p>

  <p>I'm not really sure why i'm writing this blog, but it gives me the opportunity to talk about stuffs
  that i like. If you like it, cool; if you don't please tell me why, i'm also interested to
  improve myself. :)</p>
